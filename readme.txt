This moneymaking plugin from owagu.com places a context sensitive clickbank adblock underneath the posts. It only shows on full posts and naturally contains the correct links with your personal clickbank ID embedded.
 
== Description ==
 
Earn extra revenue by placing this clickbank adblock underneath your posts. This owagu.com plugin will look at your page's content and will then place a relevant clickbank ad-block underneath your single (full) posts
with not one, but 2 relevant links (not unlike adsense). Both links will have your personal clickbank ID embedded which can be set in the administration panel under "settings". This block has black text on a white background
with links colored blue, and will share some links with the maker in order to keep this plugin completely white-label and free (It therefore does not contain any links back to the maker on the frontend of your wordpress installation).
